# Contact-app

A simple contact app made using react and json server

What i learned:
- A bit of semantic ui
- React router dom
- json-server and axios , a little bit of get,post,delete,put requests
- Code refactoring
- I know absolutely nothing about backend and deployments
- How to calm yourself down?
- How to stop yourself from banging your head on the wall?
- dont look at outdated tutorials

Wanted to deploy but after hours of trying, nothing works :|
